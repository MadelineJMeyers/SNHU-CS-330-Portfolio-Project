# SNHU-CS-330-Portfolio-Project

## This is a project I created during my time at SNHU while studying for my Bachelor's of Computer Science

### How do I approach designing software?
1. What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

This project has helped me understand better how to create a 3D environment with custom lighting and textures for each object to create a dynamic and interesting setting.

2. What design process did you follow for your project work?

My process began by taking reference photos of the scene I wanted to create and breaking down the objects into their basic shapes. From there I was able to craft each object into a basic 3D object and begin working with textures, materials, and different lightings.

3. How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

By breaking down each object near the beginning I was able to see how each object could come together. This can be used with any project as most projects, no matter how complex, can be broken down and examined. From this breakdown the steps needed to complete each part becomes easier to understand and a plan can be formed with the foundational steps being able to be taken first and building towards a fully realized project one step at a time.

### How do I approach developing programs?


1. What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

My main strategy for this project was to think through what was required for completion for each step of the process and working through these steps one at a time. First creating a rough idea of what I wanted to create and then refining the idea until I created something I was proud of. If there was something I needed help with I was able to find help in my resources and implementing the solutions I could find.

2. How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration was a key factor for success with this project because each step required a good amount of detail to reach my expectations. When creating the materials for each object I needed some time to experiment, to see how each type of material could be used under different lightings and to decide which was worth keeping throughout the project. I also needed some time to get the camera to work as I needed it for the multiple angles of focus I created. Without iteration I would have a half finished project that would not show my understanding nearly as well as my project as it is. There are still some areas I could improve in the future but as of the creation of this portfolio entry I am satisfied with my work.

3. How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

Honestly, my approach has been consistent with working through each problem step-by-step and researching ways to implement my ideas. I think this method has led me to my greatest amount of success with all of my projects in my portfolio. First, break down the problem, then think through what needs to be done, research the problem if needed, implement a rough solution and refine as needed. 

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
1. How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
2. How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

In both of these instances it has been reinforced that my approach with developing software and learning new concepts is very similar and have similar solutions. If anything I feel like this project has given me more direction than other projects which shows that I can create visually interesting scenes easily and if I were to work with a team we could create amazing collaborative efforts. This project has also helped me learn more about using OpenGL which can definitely help me when creating GUI elements for software projects in the future. Ultimately, my future career and education will be filled with instances of rough drafts that will be refined into amazing projects and I look forward to the challenges I will face down the line.
